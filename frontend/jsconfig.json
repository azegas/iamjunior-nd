// When VSCode's Ctrl+Click or Go to Definition fails to navigate to the source file (could not go from Loading component to Spinner component),
// VSCode may not resolve absolute imports without correct configuration in your projectâ€™s jsconfig.json or tsconfig.json file.
// This tells VSCode how to resolve @ as the base folder (src in this case).
// After editing the configuration file, restart VSCode for it to take effect
